# Action Bar

The action bar is generally used at the bottom of modals to present the user with a set of actions. These actions are often relative to choices or selections made in the containing modal. 

The most common choices are "Save/apply" and "Cancel".Â  At least one button (Cancel) is the absolute minimum.
