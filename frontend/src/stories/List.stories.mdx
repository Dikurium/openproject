# List

Lists are simply a collection of components in a vertical list. They can be used inside modals like dropdowns, within a small scrollable module, or anywhere else a series of items needs to be presented.

This component does not have a Figma object associated with it, since a group of elements itself is the list. This component represents lists that are interactive (checkboxes and drop down selections), or when the list is generated as a result of interaction. The items in the list are all individual components (or list primitives).

This list is not to be confused with a standard HTML list element, which generates a bullet list of text. For this, a component is not needed in the Design System.

# Behaviour

Items are displayed stacked vertically. The behaviour of each individual element is inherited from properties of that element.

Lists also allow nesting. Each nested item has an additional 16px padding to the left in relation to its parent.

The dimensions of the list are defined by the dimensions of the containing element, and its overflow rules.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <ul class="spot-list">
      <li class="spot-list--item">Item one</li>
      <li class="spot-list--item">Item two</li>
      <li class="spot-list--item">Item three</li>
    </ul>
  </Story>
  <Story name="As links">
    <ul class="spot-list">
      <li class="spot-list--item">
        <a href="#" class="spot-list--item-action">First link</a>
      </li>
      <li class="spot-list--item">
        <a href="#" class="spot-list--item-action">Second link</a>
      </li>
      <li class="spot-list--item">
        <a href="#" class="spot-list--item-action">Third link</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

# Compact

The compact version makes the items a little bit less tall.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Compact">
    <ul class="spot-list spot-list_compact">
      <li class="spot-list--item">
        <a href="#" class="spot-list--item-action">First link</a>
      </li>
      <li class="spot-list--item">
        <a href="#" class="spot-list--item-action">Second link</a>
      </li>
      <li class="spot-list--item">
        <a href="#" class="spot-list--item-action">Third link</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Story>
